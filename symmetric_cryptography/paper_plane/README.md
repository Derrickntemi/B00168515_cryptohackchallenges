# Explanation
The ciphertext is generated by performing E(m ^ C0) ^ M0, we can retrieve the flag by performing a padding oracle attack, we can modify the last character and check if the generated padding is valid by verifying that the JSON response doesn't contain an error
We will do this for all the remaining characters to reconstruct the flag.


# flag
