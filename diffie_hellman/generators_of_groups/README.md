# Explanation
We are asked to find a generator (g) for a cyclic group of mod P = 28151. A generator is a number such that for all powers of g mod p produce every number in the group.  This can be represented as

- g^1 % P, g^2 % P, ..., g^(P-1) % P = all values in {1, 2, ..., P-1} (g is a primitive root modulo P)
