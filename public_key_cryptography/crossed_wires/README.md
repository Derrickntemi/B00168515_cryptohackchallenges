# Explanation
To decrypt the messages, we will iterate through the friends' public keys in reverse and compute their private keys using modular inverse of d mod phi, where d is the public key and phi is (p - 1) * (q - 1), p & q are the factors of N.
Using the computed private keys wwe will decrypt the flag using modular exponentiation of the ciphertext (c ^ e mod N).
