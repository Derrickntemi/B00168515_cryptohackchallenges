# Explanation
Some RSA keys re-use the same prime numbers, so given a list of RSA keys, we can check which two keys use prime numbers that share a common factor, 
For example, suppose that I have the key 269107 = 439 * 613 and someone else has the key 440747 = 719 * 613. If we compute the GCD of 440747 and 269107 then we will discover the common prime 613, and a division would give us the other factor. Henceforth, we can compute the private exponent
d and using that we can decrypt the message.
