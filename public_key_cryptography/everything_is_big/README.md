# Explanation
The flag is encrypted by modular exponentiation of the message using e and N, where e is generated by computing the modular inverse of d mod phi (p - 1 * q - 1) and N is a product of 2 large prime numbers.
To decrypt the flag, we factorize N into p and q, then compute the phi (p - 1 * q - 1), then generate d by computing the modular inverse of e mod phi. Finally, to retrieve the message we perform a modular exponentiation of the ciphertext c (c ^ d mod N)
