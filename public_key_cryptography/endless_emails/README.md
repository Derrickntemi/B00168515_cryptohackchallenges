# Explanation
We can recover the plaintext message using the Hastadâ€™s Broadcast Attack. Since we have 7 cipher texts, C1...C7, where C = M**3 mod N, and distinct modulus numbers that are co-prime, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem and taking the 3rd root of the combined ciphertext we can recover the plaintext.
